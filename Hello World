- 👋 Hi, I’m @asliarda
- 👀 I’m interested in sustainability, meteorology, sports, movies and good music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code because I would like to use my expertise in sustainability in coding. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that you have currently. I want to improve myself and observe different possibilities! Get out of your comfort zone! 
- 📫 How to reach me, you can find me in the same name on LinkedIn, and I would be happy to get in touch :)
- 😄 Quote describes me the most: Humble enough to know that I am not better than anybody. Wise enough to know that I am different from the rest. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know if it's fun or even a fact but I love to play video games :)
